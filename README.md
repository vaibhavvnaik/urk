# urk — Promotional Newsletter Aggregator

> **Live at [urklist.com](https://urklist.com)** — a unified feed of brand promotional emails, organized by category so you never miss a deal.

---

## What It Does

Brands constantly send promotional emails — sale alerts, promo codes, limited-time offers — but they get buried in your inbox. **urk** aggregates these promotional newsletters from 15+ retail categories into a single browsable feed.

A dedicated inbox receives brand emails. urk captures each one, extracts the subject line, pulls the brand thumbnail, and surfaces it in a filterable, date-ranged feed organized by category.

## Key Features

- **15 category feeds** — Grocery, Footwear, Home, Clothing, Auto, Health & Beauty, Entertainment, Travel, Babies & Kids, Sporting Goods, Pets, Luggage, Restaurants, Electronics, Lux
- **Date range filter** — narrow the feed to any time window (e.g. "March 4 to March 5")
- **Brand cards** — each card shows brand thumbnail, email subject line as headline, and timestamp
- **Real brands** — DSW, Costco, Anker, and 20+ other retail brands currently aggregated
- **Promo code extraction** — AI-powered parsing of email bodies to surface discount codes directly (in development)

## The Problem It Solves

Promotional emails expire before most people see them. They compete with 40 other unread emails, lack consistent formatting, and no single place exists to browse "what deals are live right now."

urk treats promotional emails as structured data — each email becomes a card in a browsable, categorized, date-filtered feed.
